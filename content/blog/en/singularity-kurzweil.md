# The Singularity Is Near - Ray Kurzweil

## Exponential Growth

Kurzweil is the main prophet of techno-optimism. His law of accelerating returns says that technological progress is exponential, not linear. We intuitively linearlize the future, which is why we are constantly surprised by the pace of change.

## Predictions vs Reality

Reading this book years later is an interesting experiment.
*   **Approved**: The computing power of computers, the democratization of AI, the development of genetics.
*   **Missed (so far)**: Full immersion VR, nanobots in the blood.

However, the main thesis - that AI will reach the level of human intelligence (and then surpass it) around 2029-2045 - seems more and more likely with each GPT release.

## Transhumanism

The book raises questions about the essence of humanity. If we can upload our mind to the cloud, are we still ourselves? Kurzweil believes that technology is the natural evolution of humanity.

## Summary

A bit dense and full of charts, but gives a powerful framework for thinking about the future. It allows you to look at today's AI breakthroughs (like Gemini or Sora) as points on a predictable curve, rather than random events.
