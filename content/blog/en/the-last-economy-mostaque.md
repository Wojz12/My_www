# The Last Economy - Emad Mostaque

*Note: This is a hypothetical review, based on the thoughts of Emad Mostaque (founder of Stability AI), as the book itself is a collection of his essays/speeches.*

## Abundance of Intelligence

Mostaque argues that AI brings the cost of intelligence/cognition down to zero. Just as the internet lowered the cost of information distribution to zero. What happens to the economy when "thinking" becomes almost free?

## Decentralization

A key theme is Open Source AI. Mostaque believes that for the future to be safe and fair, AI technology cannot be in the hands of a few monopolists. It must be open, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

## Education and Creativity

In the new economy, we don't need to learn facts (AI has them). We need to learn asking questions, synthesis, and creative connections. The role of humans shifts from "processor" to "conductor".

## Summary

A visionary look at the macro-economic effects of the revolution we are currently experiencing. It forces us to think not only about *how* to build AI, but *what* structure of society we want to build with it.
