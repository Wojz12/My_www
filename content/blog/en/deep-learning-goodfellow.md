# Deep Learning - Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville

## Introduction

Often called the "Bible of Deep Learning", this book is a must-have position on the shelf of every AI engineer. Although the field is developing at a dizzying pace, the foundations presented in this book remain unchanged.

## Who is this book for?

It is strictly a technical position. It requires a solid mathematical foundation (linear algebra, probability, information theory). It is not a popular science book to read before bed (unless you want to fall asleep quickly ;)).

## Key concepts

The book comprehensively covers:
- **Mathematical intricacies**: From gradients to optimization.
- **Classic architectures**: CNN, RNN, Autoencoders.
- **Regularization methods**: Dropout, Batch Norm.
- **Generative models**: GANs (co-invented by Goodfellow).

## Is it worth it in 2024?

Yes, but with a reservation. If you want to understand *why* models work, this book is irreplaceable. If you just want to learn how to use PyTorch/TensorFlow, choose newer tutorials.

This book gives a deep intuition that distinguishes an engineer from a "script kiddy". Understanding the math behind backpropagation allows you to debug models and create new architectures, rather than just blindly copying code from GitHub.

## Summary

A difficult, demanding, but extremely rewarding reading. It is a solid foundation on which you can build knowledge about the latest Transformers or Diffusion Models.
