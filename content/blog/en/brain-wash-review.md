# Brain Wash - David Perlmutter

## Detox for the brain

In the world of coding and constant learning, we often forget about the "hardware" our software runs on - our brain. Perlmutter shows how modern lifestyle (processed food, lack of sleep, chronic stress, digital noise) leads to inflammation in the brain.

## Key lessons

*   **Prefrontal Cortex vs Amygdala**: Bad habits cut us off from the analytical part of the brain (prefrontal) and leave us at the mercy of the impulsive part (amygdala).
*   **Diet**: Sugar and inflammatory fats act like fog for the mind.
*   **Nature**: Contact with nature is not a luxury, it is a physiological necessity for the regeneration of attention.

## My implementation

After reading this book, I introduced:
1.  **Digital Detox**: Evenings without screens.
2.  **Intermittent Fasting**: Better focus in the morning.
3.  **More movement**: Even a short walk resets cognitive resources.

## Summary

A mandatory position for "knowledge workers". If you want your neural network (the biological one) to work efficiently, you need to take care of its physical substrates.
