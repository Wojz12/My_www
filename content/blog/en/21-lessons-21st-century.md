# 21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Yuval Noah Harari

## How did I come across this book?

This is a book that my dad recommended and gave to me. I read it at the beginning of my high school education, and it forever changed my perspective on the world.

## What fascinated me?

Harari brilliantly showed how algorithms control our modern world, and this trend is unlikely to be reversed anytime soon. He discusses current human problems - from AI to climate change and social inequality.

As someone working with LLMs and AI systems, I see these mechanisms Harari wrote about every day. What was a vision of the future in 2018 is our reality today.

## My thoughts

The book is from 2018, but it remains a relevant position. Many of Harari's predictions have come true, and the problems he described - like the impact of AI on the job market or data privacy - are even more pressing today.

Wait stuck in my memory especially fragments about:
- The role of AI in shaping society
- Challenges of education in the era of automation
- The need for global cooperation in the face of global problems

## Summary

It's one of those books that change the way you think. Harari doesn't give easy answers but forces reflection on the direction humanity is heading. I especially recommend it to people interested in the future of technology and its impact on society.
